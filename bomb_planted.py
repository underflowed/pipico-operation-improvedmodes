"""
It's just another average day in the ER, your fresh out of your Residency and ready to really make a difference in the medical field
In comes a patient at breakneck speed, police following suit, you ask the officer leading the rest what the situation is.


Someone, You have no clue who, you have no clue why
Has planted an actual fucking bomb in this guy disguised amongst 13 multiple cheap plastic game pieces to the game "Operation"

God Help You

-In this game mode all of the pieces will be randomized
-All of them will be set to 0 rumble power... Except 1, which will be set to 100%, hitting that piece will make the game rumble for 3 seconds
-The game will print a list of all the pieces, select the one you will be attempting to remove and then perform the operation
-Press space when youve finished removing the item and keep going
- You win by removing all but the "Bomb"

Choose wisely
